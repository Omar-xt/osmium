# Osmium

Python Interpreter written in Zig

ONLY works with the Python 3.10 standard. Will be expanded later, just easier for development now.

# Status

I work on this in my limited free time, so nothing crazy. 
**BARELY WORKS**.

- [x]  Variables and stuff
- [x]  Assignments
- [x]  Math
- [x]  User-defined function calling
- [ ]  Builtin Functions https://github.com/Rexicon226/osmium/issues/4
- [ ]  User-defined function returns
      
anything else hasn't been done yet.

Planning to get to around ~95% hopefully? I don't think 100% is that difficult, but I am guessing at some point I'll enter the realm of edge-case hell and give up.

# Contributing

- The code is far from clean, and usually written at zero dark stupid, so if you can read it have a go. I will definitely do a round of comments and cleanups when I get more progress.
- Don't waste your time implementing major features without my approval (see below), as I need to know the code well myself and probably won't accept it.
- Typo PRs aren't welcome as they're dumb. I'll see it as some point.

# Contact

Message at `telaxion` on Discord (i don't sleep), or you can email me as well at `daviru007@icloud.com`, I'll probably see it.
